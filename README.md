# Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analysing employee attrition data to understand the key factors that influence employees leaving an organisation. Using data analysis and visualisation techniques, the notebook explores trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset to help organisations improve employee retention and workforce planning.

The analysis aims to identify potential drivers of attrition such as income, age, department, job role, and work-life balance.
